"""Reusable validated field types.

Pydantic was already parsing every request body, but parsing is not the same as
validating: a field typed `str` accepts a five-thousand-character string, and a
field typed `Decimal` accepts a negative one. Both went straight through to
Postgres, where the first became a 500 from a column-length violation and the
second became a menu item priced at minus one hundred rupees.

These types are kept together rather than spread across the schema modules so
the input policy can be read in one place - the same reason the rate limits
live in limits.py. Each one is sized to the database column behind it, so a
value that would fail at the database fails at the edge instead, as a 422 that
names the field.
