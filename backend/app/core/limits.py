"""Where every rate limit is set, and why.

Kept in one file on purpose. Limits scattered across routers are impossible to
review as a whole - you cannot tell what is unprotected without reading
everything - and these numbers are a security control, so they should be
auditable at a glance.

Each limit is sized by the harm it prevents, not by a uniform house style.
Reading a menu is cheap and gets a loose limit; sending an email costs money
and gets a tight one.

# The per-address limits inside the OTP service (one code per minute, ten per
# hour, five guesses per code) stop an attacker working one account. These stop

# addresses, and because each request sends a real email that is both an
# account-enumeration engine and a way to burn the Resend quota - which, once
# spent, locks every legitimate student out of logging in.

# generous on purpose, because throttling a platform healthcheck would read as
# a dead service and roll the release back.
