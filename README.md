# Hunger Birds

Campus food ordering for BIT Mesra. Students browse the food stalls on campus,
place cash-on-delivery orders, and watch the status update live; stall owners
manage their menu and work through incoming orders from a separate app.

- **Customer app** (Flutter) — browse stalls, order, track live
- **Merchant app** (Flutter) — stall dashboard, live order queue, menu management
- **Backend** (FastAPI + Postgres + Redis) — API, auth, realtime

Sign-up is restricted to `@bitmesra.ac.in` email addresses. Payment is cash
only — there is no payment gateway.

## Repository layout

```
backend/               FastAPI service (API, auth, WebSockets)
apps/customer_app/     Flutter app for students
apps/merchant_app/     Flutter app for stall owners
packages/hb_shared/    Shared Dart: models, API client, login flow, theme
```

## How it works

**Auth.** A student enters their institute email; the backend generates a
6-digit code, stores it in Redis with a 5-minute TTL, and emails it through
Resend. Verifying the code issues a JWT access/refresh pair. Only
`@bitmesra.ac.in` addresses are accepted, and `+tag` addressing is normalised
away (`me+1@…` and `me@…` are the same account) so one person can't spin up
unlimited accounts.

Access tokens carry the id of the session that issued them, and every
authenticated request checks that the session is still live. That is what makes
signing out mean something: revoking a session ends its access token on the next
request rather than leaving it usable until it expires on its own.

**Vendors.** Anyone can apply to run a stall, but the stall stays invisible to
students until an admin approves it. Approved stalls also carry an
open/closed switch the owner controls from their app.

Approval gates what a stall can *do*, not just what students can see: a stall
that is pending review or has been suspended can read its own record - so the
app can tell the owner they are pending - and nothing else. It cannot reach its
orders (and the customer names and phone numbers on them), move an order through
the status machine, edit its menu, reopen itself, or mint an image-upload permit.

**Orders.** A cart holds items from one stall. Placing an order snapshots each
item's name and price, so later menu edits never rewrite order history. Status
moves through an explicit state machine — `placed → accepted → preparing →
ready → completed`, with `rejected`/`cancelled` as terminal branches — and
invalid jumps are rejected by the API.

Who may cancel is narrower than what the state machine allows. A customer can
cancel up to `accepted`; once the food is being made, they cannot. The stall can
cancel from any non-terminal state, so it always has a way to release an order it
cannot fill, and an admin can force-cancel one with
`POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/cancel`. Without those two exits an order that
reached `preparing` could only be advanced by the stall, so a stall that went
quiet left the customer holding an order nobody was able to close.

**Realtime.** Every status change publishes to Redis pub/sub. The customer's
tracking screen subscribes to `order:{id}` and the merchant's queue to
`vendor:{id}`, so both sides update within a second without polling. Clients
re-fetch on reconnect, so nothing is lost if a socket drops.

## Running the backend locally

Requires Python 3.11+, Postgres and Redis.

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env          # then edit DATABASE_URL / JWT_SECRET
alembic upgrade head
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/seed.py    # optional: demo stalls + admin user

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --no-proxy-headers
```

`.env.example` sets `ENVIRONMENT=development`, which unlocks two local
conveniences: `OTP_DEBUG_ECHO=true` makes the login endpoint return the OTP in
its response, so you can sign in without a Resend key, and CORS is opened to
Vite's ports so the web app can call the API across origins. Both are inert
without `ENVIRONMENT=development`, so neither can be switched on in production
by setting a single variable.

It also sets `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=0`, because nothing sits in front of the app
locally. Combined with `--no-proxy-headers` above, that means `X-Forwarded-For`
is ignored entirely and rate limits key off the real connection — matching how
production behaves behind Railway's one proxy.

To make a user an admin, have them log in once, then:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/promote_admin.py you@bitmesra.ac.in
```

## Running the apps

```bash
cd apps/merchant_app
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

Point `API_BASE_URL` at the deployed URL to run against production — note the
`/api` suffix. On an Android emulator, localhost on the host machine is
`http://10.0.2.2:8000/api`.

> `apps/customer_app` is the retired Flutter customer app. The customer side is
> now the web app in `apps/web`; that directory is kept only as history.

### The customer web app

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api npm run dev
```

In production no such variable is set: the API is same-origin under `/api`, so
the deployed hostname never has to be baked into the bundle.

Tests: `flutter test` in either app, `flutter analyze` for lints.

## Building installable APKs

Sideloading is the practical way to get these onto phones on campus — no Play
Store account needed. Android only; iOS requires a $99/yr Apple Developer
account even for TestFlight.

### One-time: create a release keystore

Do this once, on your own machine. The same keystore signs **both** apps.

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/hungerbirds-release.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias hungerbirds
```

Then, in **each** app, copy `android/key.properties.example` to
`android/key.properties` and fill in the password, alias, and absolute path to
the `.jks`. Both files are gitignored and must stay that way.

> **Back up the `.jks` file and its passwords somewhere permanent.** Android
> identifies an app by its signing key. If you lose the keystore, you cannot
> ship an update to an already-installed app — every user has to uninstall and
> reinstall, losing their login. There is no recovery path.

Without `key.properties`, release builds silently fall back to the debug key.
That's fine for `flutter run --release` on your own device, but never hand out
a debug-signed APK: the debug key differs per machine, so the same
uninstall/reinstall trap applies.

### Build

```bash
cd apps/merchant_app
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi \
  --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://<your-service>.up.railway.app/api
```

Output lands in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`. Hand out
**`app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`** — essentially every phone from the last several
years is arm64. `--split-per-abi` keeps it ~10–15MB instead of one ~40MB fat
APK.

Confirm it's signed with your release key, not the debug key:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
```

Recipients need to allow "install from unknown sources" when opening the file.

## Deployment (Railway)

Build, start, migrations and healthcheck all come from `railway.json` at the
repo root.

**One service serves everything.** The Docker build compiles the customer web
app and the API copies the result into `backend/static`, serving it alongside
the API on the same origin. That means one Railway service instead of two (half
the cost), no CORS to configure, and no deployed hostname baked into the
frontend bundle at build time.

The API lives under **`/api`**, which is load-bearing rather than cosmetic:
without it the API's `GET /orders/{id}` shadows the web app's `/orders/:id`
tracking route, and refreshing that page returns JSON instead of the page.
`/health` and `/health/ready` stay at the root for the deploy healthcheck.

The backend builds from `backend/Dockerfile`. It started on Railway's Nixpacks
builder, but that produced an image missing `libstdc++.so.6` — which greenlet's
compiled extension links against, and SQLAlchemy's async engine routes every
query through greenlet. The result was an app that booted, passed `/health`,
and then failed on its first database call while `alembic upgrade head` failed
the same way. Pinning a Debian base makes the C runtime predictable rather
than something rediscovered per deploy.

The slim build compiles Python and then purges its build dependencies, and the
C++ runtime goes with them — so the Dockerfile installs `libstdc++6` back
explicitly. That step was once blamed for a failed build and the image was
moved to the full `python:3.11` to avoid it; the diagnosis was wrong (see the
Root Directory note above) and it has since been moved back, because slim is
~150MB against ~1GB. You don't need Docker installed —
Railway builds the image.

### Deploying to a fresh Railway account

1. **New Project** → **Empty Project**.
2. **+ New** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**.
3. **+ New** → **Database** → **Add Redis**.
4. **+ New** → **GitHub Repo** → pick this repo.
5. On that service: **Settings** → **Root Directory** → leave it **empty**
   (the repo root). The Docker build needs both `backend/` and `apps/web/`, so
   the context has to be the whole repo. Everything else is read from
   `railway.json`. *If you previously set this to `backend`, clear it — with
   it set the build can't see `apps/web` and fails.*

7. **Settings** → **Networking** → **Generate Domain**.

The first deploy runs migrations before booting, then has to pass
`/health/ready` — which queries Postgres *and* pings Redis — so a green deploy
is itself proof both databases are wired up correctly.

Migrations run as `alembic upgrade head`. The Docker image installs packages
with pip into `/usr/local`, which is on PATH, so this works both as the
pre-deploy step and in the service's **Console** tab:

```bash
alembic current      # which revision is applied
alembic upgrade head # apply the rest
```

If you ever see `alembic: command not found` in the Console, you're on a
Nixpacks-built image rather than this Dockerfile — there the virtualenv lives
at `/opt/venv` and isn't on the shell's PATH, so use
`/opt/venv/bin/alembic` instead.

`/health/ready` does **not** catch a missed migration — it only runs a trivial
query, so it passes against an out-of-date schema while every real query
against `users` fails with *column users.phone does not exist*.

### Variables

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` — a Railway **reference**, not a pasted URL |
| `REDIS_URL` | `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}` — likewise |
| `JWT_SECRET` | long random string: `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | from the Resend dashboard |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | `Hunger Birds <noreply@yourdomain>` — the domain must be verified in Resend |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | optional; photos are disabled until all three are set |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | optional |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | optional |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | your own domain, e.g. `https://hungerbirds.food`. Leave unset for none at all — correct when the backend serves the web app, which it does |

`JWT_SECRET` is checked at startup: outside development the app **refuses to
boot** on a secret shorter than 32 characters or one that looks like a
placeholder copied from this README. A forged access token is indistinguishable
from a real one, so a deployment signing with a guessable secret is not degraded,
it is unauthenticated — and it would otherwise start cleanly, pass the
healthcheck and serve traffic while anyone who had read this repository could
mint an admin token.

Everything else defaults safely and only needs setting to change it:
`ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` (`bitmesra.ac.in`), `ENVIRONMENT` (`production`),
`OTP_DEBUG_ECHO` (`false`), `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` (`1`, which is right for
Railway), `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOSTS` (empty, which is right for Railway — see the
rate-limiting notes), `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` (256 KB) and the two
`GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_*` values.

> **Never set `OTP_DEBUG_ECHO=true` on a public URL.** It returns the login
> code in the API response, which lets anyone sign in as anyone. It exists so
> you can log in locally without a Resend account. As a second line of defence
> it is ignored unless `ENVIRONMENT=development` as well, so copying it into
> Railway by accident does nothing — but don't rely on that.

> **Don't change `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` unless the number of proxies in front of
> the app changes.** It says how far into `X-Forwarded-For` to look for the real
> client address. Setting it higher than the true number of hops lets a caller
> forge that address and get a fresh rate-limit budget on every request, which
> disables the per-IP limits. Railway is exactly one hop.

If Postgres and Redis are referenced correctly, a plain `postgres://` URL is
upgraded to the asyncpg driver automatically — you don't need to rewrite it.

### Seeding

Once deployed, from the service's shell:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/seed.py
```

Creates the `admin@bitmesra.ac.in` admin plus three demo stalls. It's
idempotent (skips stalls that already exist) and deliberately *not* part of the
deploy, so it can't resurrect demo stalls you've deleted. Log in as that
address in either app to get admin access, then approve real vendors.

### Pointing the apps at it

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://<your-service>.up.railway.app/api
```

Images upload straight from the phone to Cloudinary using a short-lived
signature minted by `GET /media/signature`, so image bytes never pass through
the backend. Only an approved stall or an admin can mint one — each signature is
a write permit against the Cloudinary account, and there is no reason for every
student with a login to hold one. The signature covers the timestamp, the folder
and an `allowed_formats` list, so the permit is for images rather than for
anything the client cares to send.

> Cloudinary excludes `resource_type` from the parameters it signs, so a
> signature can still be aimed at the raw or video endpoints. Closing that off
> needs a signed **upload preset** configured in the Cloudinary dashboard,
> pinning `resource_type` and a maximum file size; `allowed_formats` is the part
> that can be enforced from here.

## Rate limiting

Every endpoint is rate limited, and the limits live in one file —
`backend/app/core/limits.py` — so they can be reviewed as a whole rather than
hunted through the routers. Each is sized by the harm it prevents:

- **Login** is limited per email address *and* per client address. The per-address
  limits stop someone working one account; the per-IP ones stop them spraying
  many, which would otherwise enumerate accounts and burn the Resend quota —
  and once that quota is spent, nobody can log in at all.
- **Orders** are capped per account, because a few hundred junk orders makes a
  stall's tablet useless during a lunch rush. That is an outage for that vendor
  even though every individual order looked legitimate.
- **Upload signatures** are capped because each one is a permit to upload to the
  Cloudinary account — unlimited permits means one user can fill the free tier
  and take image hosting down for every stall.
- **Public browsing** is capped per address; the stall detail endpoint loads a
  whole menu per call, so it is the cheapest way to put load on the database.
- **Signing out** is limited per address. It is deliberately unauthenticated —
  the refresh token is itself the proof — which also makes it the one route where
  an anonymous caller can make the database do work, so it does not get to rely
  on the blanket ceiling alone.
- **A blanket per-IP ceiling** sits under all of it, to catch a client that
  spreads abuse across many endpoints to stay below each individual limit.

Anything behind a token is counted per account rather than per address, so
switching networks doesn't reset it and the shared campus NAT doesn't punish
everyone for one person. Health checks are never throttled — a 429 there would
read as a dead service and roll back a deploy.

Two things that are easy to get wrong and are asserted by tests
(`backend/tests/test_deploy_config.py`, `backend/tests/test_ratelimit.py`):

- Uvicorn is started with **`--no-proxy-headers`**. Its default rewrites the
  client address from the *leftmost* `X-Forwarded-For` entry — the forgeable
  one. The limiter reads that header itself, from the right, trusting only
  `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` hops. If uvicorn is allowed to substitute a forged value
  underneath it, every per-IP limit becomes bypassable with one header.
- The login limits **fail closed**. If Redis is unreachable they refuse requests
  rather than allowing them, because a limiter that silently stops working there
  is the whole hole; the codes live in Redis anyway, so those endpoints cannot
  work without it. Every other limit fails open, so a Redis blip doesn't take
  the app down.
- `X-Forwarded-For` is believed only when it carries **at least**
  `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` entries. A shorter header means the request did not come
  through the proxies configured, so nothing in it was written by anything
  trusted and the peer address is used instead. It used to fall back to the
  header's leftmost entry, which is the forgeable one — so a caller reaching the
  app without the expected hop could put any value there and be counted as a
  different client on every request.

  Note what counting hops can and cannot do. It defeats a *prepended* forgery,
  because a real proxy appends its own observation to the right of whatever the
  caller sent. It cannot, by itself, tell a one-entry header a proxy added from a
  one-entry header a caller invented — those are the same bytes. What
  distinguishes them is who opened the connection, which is what
  `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOSTS` is for. Leaving it empty is correct on Railway, where the
  platform edge is the only route to the container; set it if the app is
  reachable any other way.

## Request and response hardening

**Body size.** Bodies over `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` (256 KB) are refused with a 413,
counted as the bytes actually arrive rather than read off the `Content-Length`
header. That distinction is the whole point: a request sent with
`Transfer-Encoding: chunked` carries no `Content-Length` at all, so a
declared-size check has nothing to look at and waves it through — 40 MB went
through unauthenticated before this was counted properly. Reading stops at the
limit, so an oversized request costs the cap and not what the sender chose to
send.

**Response headers.** Every response carries a Content-Security-Policy and the
usual companions (`nosniff`, `DENY`, `Referrer-Policy`,
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and HSTS outside
development). The policy is worth more here than it looks: tokens live in
`localStorage`, so an injected script would be able to read them, and
`script-src 'self'` is what stands between a future HTML-injection bug and a
session. The built `index.html` carries no inline script, so nothing needs a
nonce. `style-src` does allow inline, because React writes a handful of
`style={{…}}` props out as style attributes — a much smaller concession than
inline script would be.

`img-src` permits any https host, because a stall's `image_url` is
vendor-supplied and may point anywhere. The consequence is that whoever hosts
that image sees the IP and `Referer` of every customer who views the stall, which
is part of why `Referrer-Policy` is set. Image URLs must be https: a plain-http
one turns every page showing that stall into mixed content.

## Live updates

The apps get order updates over a WebSocket. A browser can't set headers on a
WebSocket handshake, so the credential has to travel in the URL — and URLs end
up in server logs, proxy logs and browser history. The access token therefore
never goes there. The client spends it once, over a normal authenticated
request to `POST /api/realtime/ticket`, on a ticket that is valid for 30
seconds and destroyed the moment the socket redeems it. A ticket found in a log
afterwards is worthless, and it can't be replayed.

## Things to know before going live

- **Resend needs a verified domain of its own** before it will deliver to real
  `@bitmesra.ac.in` inboxes. Until then OTP emails only reach your own Resend
  account address, so nobody else can log in. Note you can't verify
  `bitmesra.ac.in` itself — that's the institute's DNS — so register any cheap
  domain, verify it in Resend, and send from it. Sending *to* institute
  addresses is unaffected. DNS propagation is the slow part; start it early.
- **Customers must add a phone number** before their first order — the backend
  rejects an order without one, and the app prompts for it at checkout. It's
  how a stall calls about a ready order, since everything is cash on pickup.
- **Distributing the apps** is not covered here. Android can be sideloaded as
  an APK; iOS requires an Apple Developer account ($99/yr) even for TestFlight.
- **No ratings or reviews** — deliberately out of scope for the first version.
- **Keep the Python dependencies current.** `pip-audit -r backend/requirements.txt`
  is the check. Starlette in particular matters more than it looks: this service
  serves the customer web app from `backend/static` through `FileResponse` and
  `StaticFiles`, so a `FileResponse` advisory is one this app is exposed to
  directly, and `/assets/` is exempt from rate limiting by design.
